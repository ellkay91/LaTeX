	\li{Both \wprime\, \& \zprime\, 2015+2016 (36.1 fb\textsuperscript{-1}) analyses are complete.}
		\lii{With CONF notes at summer conferences and published papers on arXiv.}
	\li{Upper and lower uncertainties in cross sections for all modern NNLO PDF sets have been calculated, following various prescriptions.}
		\lii{Results are used in official ATLAS tools.}

	\li{Frequentist limit setting code for W' \& Z' (SSM + HVT) has been set up (asymptotic \& PEs)}.


	\li{Contributing studies to novel \wprime / \zprime / diboson combination effort (following discussions which took place during Exotics/SUSY workshop, Bucharest). }
	
	\li{Now working on exclusion limits in a 2D coupling plane for \wprime/\zprime.}
	
	
	\vspace{10pt}
	\textbf{Ongoing / TO DO:}
	\li{Continue making contributions to the combination effort, aiming towards an ATLAS paper.}
	\li{Continue writing thesis.}
