		\li{Each PDF set has a set of mutually independent parameters, known as `eigenvectors' formed by varying central PDF values by their systematic uncertainties. }
		\li{CT14 authors provided a reduced set of eigenvectors (from 28 $\rightarrow$\, 7), used as nuisance parameters for limit setting {\scriptsize{Respect mass dependence by applying each bundle instead of summing.}}}
		
		

		\li{Orthogonal for CC \& NC - useful step towards combined \wprime \& \zprime search.}
