	\li{$ee$ channel: plan to use search binning \& add signal resolution systematics.}
	\lii{`log-binning' was previously used due to large CPU time required for BAT.}
	\lii{No need to change binning for dimuons since the log-binning is already finer than dimuon mass resolution at high masses.}
	\li{Remove $Z$ peak (start $>$120 GeV) for $\ell\ell/\ell\nu$ combination.}
	\lii{Removing overlaps between $ee/\mu\mu$ from $\mu\mu$ spectrum (59 events at low dilepton mass).}
	\li{Will start from 200 GeV for eventual combination with dibosons.} 
	\lii{Removing events overlapping with diboson channels from $\ell\ell/\ell\nu$ from $\mu\mu$ spectra.}
