	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	
	\li{Reweighted HVT-A signal samples validated against PYTHIA.}
	
	\li{Effect of interference has been studied.}
	\lii{Plan to minimize impact by using truncated samples.}
	
	\li{Validation of statistical tools with BAT gives generally good agreement.}
	\lii{Moving on to running with HVT templates.}
	
	\li{Signal region overlaps have been quantified.}
	\lii{Very small number of common events (\textasciitilde negligible).}
	
	\li{Planned a series of templates to run on for next validation.}
	\lii{Some changes to make still, e.g. removal of QCD k-factors (see backup).}
