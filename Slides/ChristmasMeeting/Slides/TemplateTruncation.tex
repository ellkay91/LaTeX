	\lii{($g_{q}, g_{l}) =$ (-0.01, $\pm$0.01), (-0.1, $\pm$0.1), (-0.554, $\pm$0.1), (-0.554, $\pm$0.554), (-0.554, $\pm$1), (-1, $\pm$1)}
	
	\li{Dependence of cross-section deviation was found to be negligible for a broad range of coupling points without strong interference effects.}
	\li{$g_{q} =$ -0.554 and $g_{l} =$ $\pm$0.1 gave the highest deviation.}
	\lii{Optimal values were found to be $\frac{\Delta M}{\sqrt{M}}$ = 5(8) GeV for $\ell\ell(\ell\nu)$ when including this point.}
