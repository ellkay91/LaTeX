# LaTeX Templates

For posters and slides

In Slides directory there is a script to make a new set of slides:

```
sh newSlides.sh <directory> <slides title>

```
makes <directory> containing a copy of example.tex, renamed to <slides title> 
Also makes link to the template beamerthemeTemplate.sty and images which are used in the theme themeImages

Some use adobe fonts source code pro & source sans pro
