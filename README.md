# LaTeX Templates

For posters and slides

In Slides directory there is a script to make a new set of slides:

```
sh newSlides.sh <directory> <slides title>

```
makes directory (directory/slide title) containing a copy of example.tex, renamed to (slides title).tex 
Also makes links to the template (beamerthemeTemplate.sty) and images which are used in the theme (themeImages)

All templates in this repository use xelatex 
Some use adobe fonts source code pro & source sans pro

When compiling, do so twice in order to get the slide numbers right.
